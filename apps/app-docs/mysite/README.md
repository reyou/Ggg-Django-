The outer mysite/ root directory is just a container for your project. 
Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. 
Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import 
anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).
